    "Here's an interesting fact: \n\nDid you know that the first known programmable computer was called the Z3, invented by German engineer Konrad Zuse in 1941? It was used for aerodynamic calculations during World War II and was the first working machine to feature binary arithmetic and floating-point arithmetic. Despite its groundbreaking nature, the original Z3 was destroyed during the war, but a replica can be found in the Deutsches Museum in Munich. \n\nIf you're interested in more fun facts or have any specific questions, feel free to ask!\n\n@candlechart.ts",
